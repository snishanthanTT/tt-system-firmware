#   TARGET  pyocd target (die)    default stm32u375veix
#   OUT     where the build goes  default <repo>/build-output/$BOARD
#   PROBE   pyocd probe UID (-u)  default empty

#   BOARD                  TARGET        
#   tt_blackhole_glx2_dmc  stm32u375veix 
#   tt_grendel_mk_bu_dmc   stm32u375rgt6 
#   nucleo_u385rg_q        stm32u385rgtxq
#
# PROBE is only needed when pyocd can see more than one debug probe; with one
# attached it selects it automatically. `pyocd list` prints the UIDs.
#
# pyocd needs the CMSIS pack for the die once, e.g.
#   pyocd pack install stm32u375veix
