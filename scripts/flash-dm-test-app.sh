# Flash an already-built app/dm_test_app hex via pyocd. Builds nothing; use
# scripts/build-flash-dm-test-app.sh when the hex also needs to be produced.
#
#   scripts/flash-dm-test-app.sh          # flashes the last GLX2 build
#   FREQ=200k scripts/flash-dm-test-app.sh   # ...with a slower SWD clock
#   BOARD=<board> TARGET=<target> PROBE=<probe> HEX=<hex> scripts/flash-dm-test-app.sh
#
# Everything is an environment variable. The defaults are the GLX2 CMB
# bring-up path, so that one needs no variables at all:
#
#   BOARD   board whose output to flash  default tt_blackhole_glx2_dmc
#   TARGET  pyocd target (die)           default stm32u375veix
#   OUT     where the build landed       default <repo>/build-output/$BOARD
#   HEX     image to flash               default $OUT/zephyr.hex
#   PROBE   pyocd probe UID (-u)         default empty
#   FREQ    SWD clock, pyocd -f          default empty (pyocd uses 1 MHz)
#
#   BOARD                  TARGET
#   tt_blackhole_glx2_dmc  stm32u375veix
#   tt_grendel_mk_bu_dmc   stm32u375rgt6
#   nucleo_u385rg_q        stm32u385rgtxq
#
# PROBE is only needed when pyocd can see more than one debug probe; with one
# attached it selects it automatically. `pyocd list` prints the UIDs.
#
# FREQ takes 200k, 1M, or plain hertz. The probe supports only a discrete set
# of clocks and snaps the request down to the nearest one; `pyocd -vv` logs
# which. Roughly 100k to 4M is the useful band on an STLINK-V3. Slowing the
# clock is the first thing to try against a marginal SWD harness -- though a
# link that corrupts transfers at every rate is bad in a way clock speed
# cannot reach, and the harness itself is then the thing to fix.
#
# pyocd needs the CMSIS pack for the die once, e.g.
#   pyocd pack install stm32u375veix
